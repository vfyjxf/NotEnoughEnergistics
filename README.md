# Not Enough Energistics
NotEnoughEnergistics is a port of [Just Enough Energistics](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/just-enough-energistics-jee) to Minecraft 1.7.10

This mod replaces AE2's default NEI integration for the Pattern Terminal.

By default, AE2 forces the player to either have the necessary items for a recipe in their personal inventory or in their ME network.

This mod removes that functionality and allows the player to use NEI's transfer system (shift + click [?] button) to create patterns whether the player possesses the items required by the recipe.


## Features

- Automatically switch the mode of PatternTerminal.
- If an item is a probability output, then nee will not transfer it.
- Combine like stacks in processing patterns.
- Support Processing Pattern Terminal(16 -> 4 mode).
- Allow you item blackList and item  priority list, if item in them, it will not be transferred / transfer it first.(use /nee RecipeProcessor to get RecipeProcessor and identifier in log)

## Compatible Modslist as followed：

- [ ]  AppliedEnergistics2(Won't support it because AE2 doesn't register OverlayHandler)
